An implementation of the popular Bukkit/Spigot/Paper Modding API for FabricMC

[View on Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bukkit) or [Download from Jenkins](http://bukkitfabric.javazilla.com/)


## Licence
The project is licenced under GPLv3.
The package ``org.bukkit.craftbukkit`` is not from CraftBukkit but contains our re-implemented classes to retain backwards compatibility with CraftBukkit/Spigot.

## NMS Support
We do support using Spigot's ``net.minecraft.server`` classes. 

Classes and Fields will automatically remap to their intermediary counterparts *(Including Reflection!)*

Support for methods will be added soon.

## Credits
* [The Bukkit Project](https://bukkit.org/) for creating the Bukkit API
* [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org/) for maintaining the API past 1.8
* [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) for optimizing &amp; updating the API
* [GlowstoneMC](https://glowstonemc.net) for our library loader.
* [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) for creating the modern mod loader
